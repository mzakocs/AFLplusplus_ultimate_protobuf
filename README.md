## AFLplusplus_ultimate_protobuf
This is the ultimate framework for introducing protobuf mutation into an AFL++ fuzzer. There are other projects that have attempted to do this before, but they are either incomplete or only partially functional. This is a lightweight and easy-to-modify custom mutator that allows you to use libprotobuf-mutator with AFL just as easily as it is to use with libFuzzer.
